# Contributing to The jekyll-design

Hi there! We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to The jekyll-design. Your help is essential for keeping it great.

The jekyll-design is an open source project supported by the efforts of an entire community and built one contribution at a time by users like you. We'd love for you to get involved. Whatever your level of skill or however much time you can give, your contribution is greatly appreciated. There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests, helping other users by commenting on issues, or writing code which can be incorporated into The jekyll-design itself.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.


## Looking for support?

We'd love to help. Check out [the support guidelines](SUPPORT.md).

## How to report a bug

Here are a few tips for writing *great* bug reports:

* Describe the specific problem (e.g., "widget doesn't turn clockwise" versus "getting an error")
* Include the steps to reproduce the bug, what you expected to happen, and what happened instead
* Check that you are using the latest version of the project and its dependencies
* Include what version of the project your using, as well as any relevant dependencies
* Only include one bug per issue. If you have discovered two bugs, please file two issues
* Even if you don't know how to fix the bug, including a failing test may help others track it down

**If you find a security vulnerability, do not open an issue. Please email security@github.com instead.**

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in The jekyll-design, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that The jekyll-design has today have been added because our users saw the need.

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and goals of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible, including describing the problem you're trying to solve.



## Your first contribution

We'd love for you to contribute to the project.

*p.s. Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first* :smiley_cat:

## How to propose changes

Here's a few general guidelines for proposing changes:

* If you are making visual changes, include a screenshot of what the affected element looks like, both before and after.
* If you are changing any user-facing functionality, please be sure to update the documentation
* Each pull request should implement **one** feature or bug fix. If you want to add or fix more than one thing, submit more than one pull request
* Do not commit changes to files that are irrelevant to your feature or bug fix
* Don't bump the version number in your pull request (it will be bumped prior to release)
* Write [a good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)

At a high level, [the process for proposing changes](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) is:

1. One
2. Configure and install the dependencies: `script/bootstrap`
3. Make sure the tests pass on your machine: `script/cibuild`
4. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
5. Make your change, add tests, and make sure the tests still pass
7. Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged
