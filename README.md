# The jekyll-design

## Usage

1. Add the following to your site's `_config.yml`:

    ```yml
    theme: jekyll-design
    ```

## Customizing

### Configuration variables

The jekyll-design will respect the following variables, if set in your site's `_config.yml`:

```yml
title: [The title of your site]
description: [A short description of your site's purpose]
```

Additionally, you may choose to set the following optional variables:

```yml
show_downloads: ["true" or "false" to indicate whether to provide a download URL]
google_analytics: [Your Google Analytics tracking ID]
```

### Stylesheet

If you'd like to add your own custom styles:

1. Create a file called `/assets/css/style.scss` in your site
2. Add the following content to the top of the file, exactly as shown:
    ```scss
    ---
    ---

    @import "{{ site.theme }}";
    ```
3. Add any custom CSS (or Sass, including imports) you'd like immediately after the `@import` line

*Note: If you'd like to change the theme's Sass variables, you must set new values before the `@import` line in your stylesheet.*

### Layouts

If you'd like to change the theme's HTML layout:

1. Copy the original template from the theme's repository<br />(*Pro-tip: click "raw" to make copying easier*)
2. Create a file called `/_layouts/default.html` in your site
3. Paste the default layout content copied in the first step
4. Customize the layout as you'd like

### Overriding GitHub-generated URLs

Templates often rely on URLs supplied by GitHub such as links to your repository or links to download your project. If you'd like to override one or more default URLs:

1. Look at the template source to determine the name of the variable. It will be in the form of `{{ site.github.zip_url }}`.
2. Specify the URL that you'd like the template to use in your site's `_config.yml`. For example, if the variable was `site.github.url`, you'd add the following:
    ```yml
    github:
      zip_url: http://example.com/download.zip
      another_url: another value
    ```
3. When your site is built, Jekyll will use the URL you specified, rather than the default one provided by GitHub.

*Note: You must remove the `site.` prefix, and each variable name (after the `github.`) should be indent with two space below `github:`.*

## Roadmap

## Project philosophy

The jekyll-design is intended to make it quick and easy for GitHub Pages users to create their first (or 100th) website. The theme should meet the vast majority of users' needs out of the box, erring on the side of simplicity rather than flexibility, and provide users the opportunity to opt-in to additional complexity if they have specific needs or wish to further customize their experience (such as adding custom CSS or modifying the default layout). It should also look great, but that goes without saying.
